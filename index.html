            <h2>About this fuck'n web</h2>
            <p>Dear Dương Việt Hà,</p> <br/>
            <p>As I sit here at 3:26 a.m., grappling with this website, I can’t help but think about how long it’s been since I last delved into front-end design. Despite the time that has passed, I hope this project still resonates with you.</p>
            <br />
            <p>This page is more than just a digital creation—it’s a heartfelt letter I want to share with you. The design might not be perfect or entirely aligned with your tastes, and for that, I apologize. Life has been quite busy lately. Nevertheless, my hope is that you find joy in it.</p>
           <br />
            <p class="signature">With all my heart, I hope this small gesture conveys how much you mean to me.</p>
           <br />

    <section id="You_to_me">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>You to Me</h2>
            <p>Maybe it could be said that our relationship is a broken one, neither formal nor distant enough to be considered a stranger or something that never existed. Honestly, I never thought I would develop feelings for you—before 11th grade, I only knew you as someone from an older class, and you weren’t really my type. But as we gradually talked and called each other every night, ‘Boom,’ I started thinking, ‘Wow, she’s actually quite charming. Could this be worth trying?’ And fortunately, I succeeded. </p>
                <br />
                <p> For me, you are my first love, but for you, I might not be. People often say that guys are influenced by their first love and can be quite sentimental or even obsessed. It seems they are right; there was a time when I couldn’t get you out of my mind, no matter how hard I tried. I even went through a phase where I really disliked you, but I couldn’t stop hoping for another chance someday. </p>
                <br />
                <p>  And that day came. We caught up and talked again at a time when we both seemed to have grown up. I feel lucky to have had the chance to reconnect with you, but honestly, I still worry because I don’t have much to offer right now—no assets, no money, or a stable job. Setting that aside, I keep telling myself that this time will be different; I’ll just keep trying because I don’t know when I’ll get another chance.</p>
                 <br />
                 <p>  And truly, I’ve tried, and I think you realize that, which is ‘I love you.’ Even though we seem like two opposing worlds, with your outgoing nature meeting my low-key style, and our tastes and habits being quite different, don’t you think that’s what makes it so enjoyable? I like that."</p>

    <section id="Me_to_you">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Who am I to you?</h2>
            <p>"But nothing can stay joyful forever, right? Regarding this situation, I’ve thought a lot—whether to continue or to stop. Sometimes, I even felt helpless and dejected (though I didn’t cry). I feel like I’m always chasing after you because, while you are warm, I am yearning. I feel comfortable when I’m with you, but I also feel pressure—pressure from my own feelings about whether or not I should express them. </p>
                <br />
            <p> But DVH, I can’t turn back. Loving you means there’s no way out—perhaps I’ve come to see having you in my life as a habit. I love seeing you smile, when you’re embarrassed, or even when you’re angry. I love being there for you when you need me, when you’re weak or tired. I always want to be an important person in your life—that’s why I constantly ask myself, ‘Who am I to you?</p>
            <br />
            <p> In the end, what we’re searching for is a label—a designation as lovers, friends, or just something ambiguous. I’m sorry I haven’t been able to give you a perfect, formal confession. I always hope that one day I’ll tell you to dress up nicely, buy a bouquet of flowers, write you a letter, and confess my feelings in a private, special place.</p>
            <br />
            <p> Honestly, that’s not really my style. I’ve tried—I’ve spent hours picking out clothes only to end up in the simplest outfit. I’m sorry if I’ve let you down. And that’s also the reason this website was created. As I mentioned before, it’s meant to serve as a letter to you.</p>

    <section id="I_love_u">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>"Em yêu chị."</h2>
            <p>The Yagi storm hasn't arrived yet, but the storm inside me can no longer be contained. Once again, I want to ask: 'Chị, Dương Việt Hà có đồng ý làm người yêu em, Hoàng Cao Sơn không ạ?' </p>
            <br /> 
            <p> If you want to love me—love me. If you want to hug me—hug me. If you want to kiss me—kiss me. And I feel the same way; I want to hug you, kiss you, and love you. </p>
                <br />
            <p>DVH, it’s currently 4:14 a.m. You might be angry with me, but I love you very much.</p>
